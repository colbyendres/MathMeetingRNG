Purpose: To design an interactive website to test numerical knowledge of
third graders.

The following project is a simple website that allows the user to generate 
a random integer in [10,999]. It tests a student's ability to identify:

	- the parity of a number (odd/even)
	- the number of digits
	- consecutive numbers
	- how to round to the hundreds/tens place
	- how to write the number in expanded form

Two scripts are used in addition to the basic HTML/CSS. The first generates
the random integer when the corresponding button is clicked. The other
provides the answers to the following questions when the 'Show Answer'
button is pressed.
